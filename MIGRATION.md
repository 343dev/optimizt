# Migration

## 2.7.5 → 3.0.0

[sharp](README.md#png) module is now used to process PNG files.

The size of PNG files and their visual quality may differ from files processed with older versions of Optimizt.

Also, when you process PNG files in lossless mode, Optimizt will now try to preserve the original visual quality of
the image.


## 1.0.1 → 2.0.0

There were no any breaking changes. 

The version was bumped due to adding LICENSE file and publishing to GitHub.
